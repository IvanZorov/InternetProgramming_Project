# InternetProgramming_Project
IP_Project-for the 2nd part of the school year

Reference: 
  I will create web-site for amusement named: Spare time - Fun Zone. The site will contain 2 sections created by the organizer - one for music and other for games where people will be able to discuss their tastes and passions,interests in their free time - together with their "colleagues, brothers with fellow activity". Every user will be able to create his own topic for discussion. Will also have the right to create, edit or delete personal/own comment - only the administrator has the right to delete other people comments, which have some kind of damage or threat to other members of the community.
  The site has a goal to statisfy the needs of certain individuals of our society - people who want to share their interests, something thet they found and think its intresting,fun or entertaining and they want to share it with the other members of the community, who are bored and in search of music which they will like and listen while doing their duties or something in their spare time.
